What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model.It represents the structure of a document(web page) as a tree of objects(tags), allowing developers to manipulate and interact with the content, structure, and style of web pages dynamically using programming languages like JavaScript.
D = Document (The web page)
O = Object (Tags like <body> or <h1> are converted into "objects" that JS can understand)
M = Model (The tree-like structure used to organize these objects)
